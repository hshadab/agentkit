ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Browser Cache is Preventing CCTP Fixes from Loading

The CCTP PENDING error fixes have been applied but your browser cache is serving old code.

REQUIRED STEPS TO LOAD THE FIXES:

1. **Hard Refresh (Required)**:
   - Windows/Linux: Ctrl + Shift + R
   - Mac: Cmd + Shift + R
   - Or: Ctrl/Cmd + F5

2. **Alternative - Clear Browser Cache**:
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Right-click on refresh button
   - Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

3. **Nuclear Option - Clear All Cache**:
   - Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
   - Firefox: Settings > Privacy > Clear Data
   - Check "Cached images and files"

4. **Verify Fix Loaded**:
   After hard refresh, you should see these console messages:
   - "ðŸ”„ CACHE CLEAR: Loading main.js with timestamp cache buster..."
   - "ðŸš¨ CCTP FIXED OVERRIDE LOADING"
   - "ðŸš¨ EMERGENCY CCTP OVERRIDE ACTIVATED"

5. **If Still Not Working**:
   - Try incognito/private mode
   - Try a different browser
   - Disable browser extensions

The fixes ARE in place - they just need to load fresh from the server.
