feat: Add OpenAI integration for intelligent workflow parsing

- Integrate OpenAI (GPT-3.5-turbo) for parsing complex multi-person conditional transfers
- Fix standalone verification cards appearing outside workflow context
- Fix transfer polling not stopping after transaction completion
- Add person-specific proof storage for multi-recipient workflows
- Fix infinite recursion in conditional transfer parsing
- Improve JSON parsing for nested Circle API responses
- Add automatic verification step insertion for conditional workflows
- Make condition matching case-insensitive
- Add comprehensive error handling and fallback to regex parser
- Remove problematic command preprocessing that broke parser

Example: "If Alice is KYC verified send her 0.05 USDC on Solana and if Bob is KYC verified send him 0.03 USDC on Ethereum" now correctly generates 6 steps (2 proofs, 2 verifications, 2 transfers)

BREAKING: None - all changes are backward compatible
