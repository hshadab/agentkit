# How to Get REAL zkML Working with JOLT-Atlas

## Current Problem

JOLT-Atlas is installed and partially working, but it **does NOT generate complete cryptographic proofs**. Here's what happens:

1. ✅ Model loads successfully
2. ✅ Execution trace generated (11 operations)
3. ✅ Matrix setup completes (1024x1024)
4. ❌ Proof generation hangs/times out
5. ❌ No polynomial commitments created
6. ❌ No SNARK proof produced

## Why It's Not Working

The sentiment model with 14 embeddings creates polynomials that are too large:
- Polynomial degree: 2^10 (1024)
- Witness polynomials: 12 polynomials
- Total computation: Too expensive for CPU-only execution

## Solutions to Get REAL zkML

### Option 1: Even Smaller Model (FASTEST)
Create a model with only 1-2 parameters:
```rust
// Instead of 14 embeddings, use just 2
let embeddings = vec![
    vec![10],  // Deny
    vec![50],  // Allow
];
```
Expected time: 10-30 seconds

### Option 2: Accept Long Proof Times
Run the existing sentiment model but wait longer:
```bash
# Run without timeout and wait 5-10 minutes
/home/hshadab/agentkit/jolt-atlas/target/release/zkml-jolt-core profile --name sentiment
```
Expected time: 5-10 minutes

### Option 3: Use JOLT Parameters
Modify JOLT parameters to trade security for speed:
```rust
// In jolt_core configuration
const SECURITY_PARAMETER: usize = 80; // Instead of 128
const POLYNOMIAL_DEGREE: usize = 256; // Instead of 1024
```

### Option 4: GPU Acceleration
JOLT supports GPU acceleration which would make it 10-100x faster:
```bash
# Requires CUDA setup
cargo build --release --features gpu
```
Not available in current environment.

### Option 5: Use Preprocessing
Generate the proof once and reuse:
1. Generate proof parameters once (slow)
2. Save to disk
3. Load and use for quick proofs

## Step-by-Step to Get Working Proof

### 1. Create Minimal Model
```rust
// In zkml-jolt-core/src/benches/ultra_minimal.rs
pub fn build_ultra_minimal() -> Model {
    // Single input, single output
    // Just checks if input > threshold
}
```

### 2. Reduce Polynomial Size
```rust
// Reduce from 1024x1024 to 64x64
const T: usize = 4;  // Instead of 16
const K: usize = 256; // Instead of 65536
```

### 3. Test with Tiny Input
```rust
let input = vec![1]; // Single value
let shape = vec![1];  // 1D tensor
```

### 4. Run and Monitor
```bash
time /home/hshadab/agentkit/jolt-atlas/target/release/zkml-jolt-core \
  profile --name minimal --format default
```

## What Real zkML Would Give You

If working properly, JOLT-Atlas would provide:

1. **Cryptographic Proof** (~10KB)
   - Polynomial commitments
   - Opening proofs
   - Public inputs/outputs

2. **Verifiable ML Inference**
   - Proves model was executed correctly
   - Without revealing model weights
   - Without revealing intermediate values

3. **Trust-Minimized Authorization**
   - Anyone can verify the proof
   - No need to trust the prover
   - Cryptographically secure

## Current Workaround

Since real proofs aren't generating, we're using:
- Mock 4-byte "proofs" with hardcoded logic
- Simple if-then rules instead of ML
- No cryptographic security

## To Debug Further

1. Check JOLT logs:
```bash
RUST_LOG=trace cargo run --release --bin zkml-jolt-core -- profile --name sentiment
```

2. Profile where it hangs:
```bash
perf record -g cargo run --release --bin zkml-jolt-core -- profile --name sentiment
perf report
```

3. Try JOLT's own examples:
```bash
cd /home/hshadab/agentkit/jolt-atlas
cargo test --release
```

## Bottom Line

To get REAL zkML with JOLT-Atlas working in this environment, you need to:
1. **Dramatically simplify the model** (1-2 parameters max)
2. **OR wait 5-10 minutes** for proof generation
3. **OR get GPU acceleration** working

The infrastructure is there, but the computational requirements exceed what can be done quickly on CPU for any non-trivial model.
