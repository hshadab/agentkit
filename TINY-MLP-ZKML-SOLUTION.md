# Tiny MLP Solution for Real zkML with JOLT-Atlas

## The Approach

Your suggestion is exactly right! Using a tiny MLP with minimal parameters is the key to getting real zkML proofs in reasonable time (10-30 seconds).

## What We Built

### 1. Tiny MLP Architecture
```
Input Layer: 4 features [agent_type, amount_norm, operation, risk]
     ↓
Hidden Layer: 4 neurons with ReLU activation
     ↓
Output Layer: 2 logits [deny_score, allow_score]
```

**Total Parameters: Only 30!**
- Layer 1: 4×4 weights + 4 bias = 20 params
- Layer 2: 4×2 weights + 2 bias = 10 params

### 2. Key Optimizations

1. **Small Integer Weights**: Use weights like 1, 2, -1 instead of floats
2. **No Softmax**: Return logits directly (simpler polynomial)
3. **Fixed Input Size**: No dynamic shapes
4. **ReLU Only**: Simplest activation function
5. **Quantization**: Optional int8 weights for even smaller tables

### 3. Implementation

Created three versions:
- `tiny_mlp.rs`: Full 4-4-2 MLP (30 params)
- `linear_classifier`: Just 4-2 linear (10 params)  
- `ultra_minimal`: Single threshold (1 param)

## Expected Performance

| Model | Parameters | Polynomial Degree | Proof Time |
|-------|------------|------------------|------------|
| Sentiment (current) | 14 embeddings | 1024×1024 | >5 minutes |
| Tiny MLP | 30 | ~64×64 | 10-30 seconds |
| Linear Classifier | 10 | ~32×32 | 5-15 seconds |
| Ultra Minimal | 1 | ~16×16 | 2-5 seconds |

## Why It Should Work

1. **Polynomial Reduction**: 
   - From 1024×1024 = 1,048,576 constraints
   - To 64×64 = 4,096 constraints
   - **256x reduction** in computation!

2. **Simple Operations**:
   - MatMul with small matrices
   - ReLU (just max with 0)
   - No complex ops like Gather or ReduceSum

3. **JOLT-Friendly**:
   - Uses operations JOLT has optimized
   - Small lookup tables
   - Minimal memory requirements

## To Run

Once built:
```bash
# Test tiny MLP (should complete in 10-30s)
/home/hshadab/agentkit/jolt-atlas/target/release/zkml-jolt-core \
  profile --name tiny-mlp

# If still too slow, try linear classifier
/home/hshadab/agentkit/jolt-atlas/target/release/zkml-jolt-core \
  profile --name linear
```

## Current Status

✅ Model architecture defined
✅ Rust implementation created
⏳ Build in progress
⏳ Waiting to test real proof generation

## The Reality

Even with this tiny MLP:
- **Best case**: 10-30 seconds for proof
- **Realistic**: 30-60 seconds
- **If it fails**: Need even simpler (just threshold check)

This is the smallest practical neural network that still does something useful (4-input classification). Any smaller and it's not really ML anymore.

## Bottom Line

Your tiny MLP approach is the best shot at getting REAL zkML proofs with JOLT-Atlas without GPU. The 256x reduction in polynomial size should make proof generation feasible in 10-30 seconds instead of 5+ minutes.
