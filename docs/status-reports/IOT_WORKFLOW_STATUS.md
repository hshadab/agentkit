# IoT Device Proximity Workflow Status

## Completed Tasks ‚úÖ

### 1. Proof Storage and Verification System
- Proofs are stored in `proofManager.proofs` Map
- Added defensive checks for `proofManager.proofs` access
- Fixed `proofsMap` typo in blockchain-verifier.js

### 2. IoTeX Smart Contracts
- **Device Verifier**: `0x5967d15c7a6fD3ef7F1f309e766f35252a9de10d` (Nova Decider V2)
- **ioID Registry**: `0x04e4655Cf258EC802D17c23ec6112Ef7d97Fa2aF` (Official)
- **ioID Contract**: `0x1FCB980eD0287777ab05ADc93012332e11300e54` (Official)

### 3. Rewards System
- Changed from USDC to 0.01 IOTX
- Implemented `claim_rewards_request` handler in frontend
- Updated workflow executor to handle real reward claims
- Added message forwarding in Rust server

### 4. Real Zero-Knowledge Proofs
- Device proximity proof uses zkEngine with `device_proximity.wasm`
- Proof generation time: ~15 seconds
- Proof size: ~18 MB
- Verifies device is within radius 100 of center (5000, 5000)

## Workflow Steps

1. **Device Registration** ‚úÖ
   - Registers device on IoTeX using ioID
   - Creates decentralized identity (DID)
   - Transaction on IoTeX testnet

2. **Proof Generation** ‚úÖ
   - Generates real Nova proof using zkEngine
   - Uses device_proximity.wasm
   - Proves device location within proximity

3. **IoTeX Verification** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Verifies proof on-chain using Nova Decider contract
   - **Issue**: Frontend error "can't access property "get", proofManager.proofs is undefined"
   - The error occurs in the browser environment, not in our Node.js tests

4. **Claim Rewards** üîÑ
   - Claims 0.01 IOTX from device verifier contract
   - Not reached due to step 3 failure

## Current Issue

The workflow fails at step 3 (IoTeX verification) with a browser-specific error. The error suggests that somewhere in the frontend code, `proofManager.proofs.get()` is being called when `proofManager.proofs` is undefined.

### Debugging Steps Taken:
1. Added defensive checks in main.js and blockchain-verifier.js
2. Fixed `proofsMap` typo to `proofs`
3. Added initialization checks for proofManager
4. Created comprehensive test suites

### Root Cause:
The error is happening in the actual browser environment when handling the `iotex_verification_request`. The error response is sent within 10ms, suggesting it's an immediate failure rather than an async operation.

### Possible Solutions:
1. Check browser console for more detailed error stack trace
2. Ensure all JavaScript files are loaded in correct order
3. Add more defensive initialization in all frontend files
4. Consider race condition between script loading and WebSocket message handling

## Test Results

When tested with simulated browser environment:
- Device registration: ‚úÖ Success
- Proof generation: ‚úÖ Success (15s, 18MB)
- IoTeX verification: ‚úÖ Success (when mocked)
- Reward claim: ‚úÖ Success (when reached)

All blockchain interactions are configured for IoTeX testnet with real smart contracts.
