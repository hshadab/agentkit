# IoT Workflow Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Large Proof Data (19MB) WebSocket Issue
**Problem**: IoTeX verification requests containing ~19MB Nova proof data were too large for WebSocket forwarding.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created HTTP endpoint `/api/proof/:proof_id/iotex` in Rust server
- Modified workflow executor to send only proof ID via WebSocket
- Updated frontend to fetch proof data via HTTP when not in message

**Files Modified**:
- `/src/main.rs` - Added `export_proof_iotex` function
- `/parsers/workflow/workflowExecutor.js` - Removed full proof data from IoTeX messages
- `/static/js/main.js` - Added HTTP fetch fallback for proof data

### 2. Claim Rewards Step Failure
**Problem**: Workflows were failing when no rewards were available to claim, treating it as a critical failure.

**Solution Implemented**:
- Modified workflow parser to mark `claim_rewards` step as `critical: false`
- This allows workflows to complete even when no rewards are available

**Files Modified**:
- `/parsers/workflow/openaiWorkflowParserEnhanced.py` - Added `"critical": False` to claim_rewards steps

## How It Works Now

1. **Proof Generation**: zkEngine generates ~25MB Nova proof
2. **Workflow sends verification request**: Only includes proof ID (<1KB)
3. **Frontend receives request**: Fetches full proof via HTTP GET `/api/proof/{id}/iotex`
4. **Verification proceeds**: With full proof data available
5. **Rewards claim**: Attempts to claim, but doesn't fail workflow if no rewards available

## Benefits

- ✅ No more WebSocket message size limitations
- ✅ Workflows complete successfully even without immediate rewards
- ✅ All proofs remain real - no simulation or fake data
- ✅ Large Nova proofs (~25MB) handled reliably

## Testing

Test endpoints:
```bash
# Test IoTeX proof export endpoint
curl http://localhost:8001/api/proof/proof_location_1752073560903/iotex

# Should return:
# - device_id
# - coordinates (x, y)
# - proof_data (base64 encoded ~25MB)
# - public_inputs
# - metadata
```

## Notes

- The IoTeX smart contract may not always add rewards immediately after verification
- This could be due to cooldown periods or other contract-specific rules
- The workflow now handles this gracefully by marking claim_rewards as non-critical
