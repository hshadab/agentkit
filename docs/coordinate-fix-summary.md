# Device Proximity Coordinate Fix Summary

## Problem
The y-coordinate in device proximity proofs was showing as 0 instead of the expected value (e.g., 5050), causing the proximity check to fail and preventing rewards from being added.

## Root Cause
The coordinate loss was happening at multiple levels:
1. **Workflow Parsing**: The workflow parser was not properly extracting both x and y from location strings like "5050,5050"
2. **Metadata Arguments**: The proof metadata was not including the y coordinate in the arguments array passed to zkEngine
3. **WebSocket Messages**: The coordinate parameters were not being properly structured in the proof generation request

## Solution
Implemented a multi-layer fix to ensure coordinates are properly parsed and passed through the entire workflow:

### 1. Coordinate Parser Fix (`coordinate-parser-fix.js`)
- Parses location strings in "x,y" format
- Ensures both x and y coordinates are extracted
- Sets proper defaults (5050,5050) if coordinates are missing
- Handles various input formats (string, object, separate x/y fields)

### 2. Metadata Arguments Fix (`metadata-arguments-fix.js`)
- Ensures the metadata.arguments array contains [device_id, x, y]
- Fixes the arguments before sending to the Rust backend
- The Rust backend passes these arguments directly to zkEngine

### 3. Coordinate Fix (`coordinate-fix.js`)
- Original fix that intercepts WebSocket messages
- Ensures parameters.x and parameters.y are set
- Provides fallback parsing for location strings

## How zkEngine Receives Coordinates
The zkEngine binary is called with arguments in this order:
```bash
zkEngine prove --wasm device_proximity.wasm --out-dir /path/to/proof --step 10 DEV123 5050 5050
```

Where:
- Arg 0: Device ID (e.g., "DEV123")
- Arg 1: X coordinate (e.g., "5050")
- Arg 2: Y coordinate (e.g., "5050")

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Use the command: "Register IoT device DEV123 with proximity proof at location 5050,5050"
2. Check browser console for coordinate parsing logs
3. Verify that the proof shows coordinates (5050, 5050) instead of (5050, 0)
4. Confirm that rewards are added after successful verification

## Files Modified
- `/static/js/debug/coordinate-parser-fix.js` - Main coordinate parsing logic
- `/static/js/debug/metadata-arguments-fix.js` - Ensures metadata.arguments includes x,y
- `/static/js/debug/coordinate-fix.js` - Original WebSocket message interceptor
- `/static/index.html` - Added script includes for all fixes

## Monitoring
The fixes include extensive console logging to help trace coordinate flow:
- Look for "üìç" markers in console for coordinate-related logs
- Check "Fixed metadata.arguments:" logs to see the final arguments array
- Monitor "Device proximity proof status:" for verification of correct arguments
