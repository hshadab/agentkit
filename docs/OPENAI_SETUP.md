# OpenAI API Key Configuration Required

The system has been updated to send ALL prompts through OpenAI for parsing, as requested. This means:

1. **All regex and pattern matching has been removed** from `chat_service.py`
2. **Every user prompt** is now processed by OpenAI's workflow parser
3. **The system requires a valid OpenAI API key** to function

## Setup Instructions

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```bash
   cd ~/agentkit
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here
   ```

3. Restart the chat service:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "python.*chat_service.py"
   source venv/bin/activate
   python chat_service.py
   ```

## What Changed

- **No more regex patterns** - The system no longer uses any hardcoded patterns to detect command types
- **OpenAI handles everything** - All parsing is done by the OpenAI workflow parser
- **Unified processing** - Simple commands like "Generate KYC proof" and complex workflows are all handled the same way

## Testing

Once you've added your OpenAI API key, test with commands like:
- "Generate KYC proof"
- "Prove location: NYC (40.7°, -74.0°)"
- "Send 0.05 USDC to Alice if KYC compliant"

All commands will be sent to OpenAI for natural language understanding and parsing.
