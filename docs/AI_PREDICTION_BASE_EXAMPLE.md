# AI Prediction with Base Blockchain - Complete Example

## Why Blockchain is Essential

The blockchain provides three critical features that make the proof bulletproof:

1. **Immutable Timestamps**: Can't fake when the commitment was made
2. **Public Verifiability**: Anyone can verify the commitment existed
3. **Censorship Resistance**: Can't delete or hide failed predictions

## Complete Flow Example: Stock Prediction

### Step 1: Make AI Prediction (Monday 9:30 AM)
```javascript
// User asks AI for prediction
const prompt = "Analyze NVDA stock sentiment and technicals for today Jan 20, 2025";

// AI responds
const aiResponse = "NVDA will increase 3.2% today due to positive AI chip demand news and oversold RSI";

// Generate secure nonce
const nonce = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('hex');
```

### Step 2: Commit on Base Blockchain (Monday 9:31 AM)
```javascript
// Connect to Base
await window.ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' });

// Create hashes
const promptHash = keccak256(prompt + nonce);
const responseHash = keccak256(aiResponse + nonce);

// Commit on Base (Coinbase L2 - fast & cheap)
const contract = new ethers.Contract(PREDICTION_CONTRACT, ABI, signer);
const tx = await contract.commitPrediction(promptHash, responseHash);

// Wait for confirmation
const receipt = await tx.wait();
console.log('Committed on Base at block:', receipt.blockNumber);
console.log('Timestamp:', new Date().toISOString());
console.log('Transaction:', `https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/${tx.hash}`);

// Output:
// Committed on Base at block: 12389455
// Timestamp: 2025-01-20T09:31:00Z
// Transaction: https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0xabc123...
```

### Step 3: Market Closes (Monday 4:00 PM)
```javascript
// Actual outcome
const marketResult = "NVDA increased 2.9%";
```

### Step 4: Generate ZK Proof (Monday 4:01 PM)
```javascript
// Get commitment data from Base
const commitment = await contract.getCommitment(commitmentId);

// Generate ZK proof using our WASM
const proof = await zkEngine.prove({
  wasm: "ai_prediction_commitment.wasm",
  inputs: {
    prompt_hash: parseInt(promptHash.substr(0,8), 16),
    response_hash: parseInt(responseHash.substr(0,8), 16),
    commitment_timestamp: commitment.timestamp, // From Base blockchain
    reveal_timestamp: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000)
  }
});

console.log('ZK Proof generated:', proof);
```

### Step 5: Reveal with Proof (Monday 4:02 PM)
```javascript
// Reveal on Base with ZK proof
const revealTx = await contract.revealPrediction(
  prompt,
  aiResponse,
  nonce,
  proof.serialize()
);

await revealTx.wait();
console.log('Revealed on Base:', `https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/${revealTx.hash}`);
```

### Step 6: Anyone Can Verify
```javascript
// Anyone can check on Base blockchain:
const commitment = await contract.getCommitment(commitmentId);

console.log('Prediction made at:', new Date(commitment.timestamp * 1000));
console.log('Block number:', commitment.blockNumber);
console.log('Predictor:', commitment.predictor);
console.log('Revealed:', commitment.revealed);

// They can verify:
// 1. Commitment was at 9:31 AM (before market open)
// 2. Reveal was at 4:02 PM (after market close)
// 3. Hashes match the revealed content
// 4. ZK proof validates temporal ordering
```

## Why Base?

Base (Coinbase L2) is ideal for this use case:

1. **Low Cost**: ~$0.01 per commitment (vs $5+ on Ethereum mainnet)
2. **Fast**: 2-second blocks (vs 12 seconds on Ethereum)
3. **Reliable**: Backed by Coinbase infrastructure
4. **Easy Onboarding**: Users likely have Coinbase accounts
5. **ETH Compatible**: Works with MetaMask and existing tools

## What the Blockchain Proves

```
Blockchain (Base) proves:
├── WHEN commitment was made (block timestamp)
├── WHO made the commitment (wallet address)
├── WHAT was committed (hash values)
└── ORDER of events (block numbers)

ZK Proof proves:
├── Hashes match revealed content
├── Commitment < Reveal timestamp
├── Within valid timeframe
└── No tampering occurred
```

## Security Properties

1. **Can't Backdate**: Base blockchain timestamps are immutable
2. **Can't Delete**: Once committed, it's permanent
3. **Can't Cherry-pick**: Must reveal what you committed
4. **Public Audit**: Anyone can verify on basescan.org

## Implementation in Your System

1. Add Base support to your existing blockchain verifier
2. Deploy the commitment contract on Base Sepolia
3. Use same ZK proof WASM (already created)
4. Integrate with your workflow system

The Base blockchain makes the temporal commitment cryptographically bulletproof - without it, users could simply lie about when they made predictions.
